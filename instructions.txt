1) Start the containers
    $ ./setup.sh
    NOTE: Bash is launched for 6 containers by default (PLC1, PLC2, HMI1 and their respective wrappers)
          The following instructions can be applied to all other containers 
3) Run the Modbus server from each PLC containers (By default Modbus/TCP)
    plc/code
    ╰─$ python3 plc.py [server_options]
4) Run the wrapper from each Wrapper container 
    wrapper/code
    ╰─$ ./start.sh

    NOTE: If the HMI and PLC containers haven't previously communicated with each other, their ARP caches will be empty 
         and the wrappers won't be able to intercept their traffic.
         In this case, run any tool that establishes a connection with the PLCs from the HMI (e.g. rodbus-client, ping etc) 
         in order to populate its cache

5) After the wrappers have been started, run any client tool from the HMI and confirm that packets are succesfully intercepted and forwarded
    rodbus/target/debug 
    ╰─$ ./rodbus-client -h 192.168.1.125:5020 rc --start 0 --quantity 5

    NOTE: Rodbus should already be built by the time the HMI containers are created. If not, run "cargo build ." from inside the rodbus directory
