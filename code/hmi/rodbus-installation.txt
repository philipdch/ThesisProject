This project relies on Rodbus, a rust Modbus client which can be found here:
https://github.com/stepfunc/rodbus.git

After cloning this repo, simply clone Robus into the current directory.
When building the HMI container, docker will take care of building the rust application.

The executable will be located inside the target/debug directory
